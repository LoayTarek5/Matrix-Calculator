# Matrix Calculator Application

## Overview

The Matrix Calculator Application is an advanced matrix computation tool designed for educational purposes, especially for the MA214 (Math-3) course. It offers a variety of matrix operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced linear algebra computations, all wrapped in a user-friendly GUI.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Basic Operations**:
  - Matrix Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication.
  - Matrix Transposition.
  - Determinant Calculation.

- **Advanced Operations**:
  - LU Decomposition (Doolittle and Crout methods).
  - Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Computation.
  - Matrix Inversion.
  - Cholesky Decomposition.
  - Matrix Norms (Frobenius, 1-Norm, Infinity Norm).
  - Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization.
  - System of Linear Equations Solver.

- **Custom Matrix Arithmetic**:
  - Supports custom operations using scalar multipliers and addition/subtraction combinations.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Resizeable input matrices with a dynamic table interface.
- Result display in a dedicated table.
- Dark theme styling for modern visuals.
- Tabs for organized basic, advanced, and single matrix operations.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for the application.
- **Qt Framework**: For GUI development.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Qt Framework (e.g., Qt Creator or Qt Installer)
